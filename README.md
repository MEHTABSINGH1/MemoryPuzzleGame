Description:
The Memory Puzzle Game is a visually engaging and interactive brain-teasing application created using Python and Tkinter. The game is designed to test and improve users' memory skills through a fun and challenging experience.

The game offers three levels of difficulty—Easy, Medium, and Hard—which feature progressively larger grids and a variety of geometric shapes and colors. Players must uncover matching pairs of shapes hidden on a grid by clicking on tiles,
and the objective is to match all pairs in as few moves as possible.

Key Features:

1)Interactive Gameplay: Players interact with a grid of hidden shapes, aiming to uncover matching pairs by clicking on the tiles.
2)Three Levels of Difficulty:
Easy: 4x4 grid with basic shapes and colors.
Medium: 6x6 grid with a wider variety of shapes and colors.
Hard: 8x8 grid featuring complex patterns and additional colors.
3)Real-Time Scoring: The game tracks the number of moves taken to match all pairs, challenging players to beat their previous scores.
4)Dynamic Graphics: The puzzle includes visually distinct shapes (rectangles, ovals, polygons) and a broad spectrum of colors, providing a colorful and visually appealing experience.
5)Randomized Grids: Each game starts with a randomly shuffled set of tiles, ensuring a unique challenge every time.
6)Technology Stack:

Python: Core programming language for logic implementation.
Tkinter: Python’s standard GUI library for creating the graphical interface and canvas-based drawing.
Random Module: Used to shuffle the placement of puzzle pieces to ensure varied gameplay each session.
